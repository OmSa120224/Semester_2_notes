# Unorganized Clutter
#### Rationalizing of Choice based on my personal BIAS
* Talk about PBL and how the education in AAU is build on groups and groupwork. 
* Talk about different types of collaborative work/study in general (in here one could also talk about different types of learning)
* Talk about coding and individual/collaborative coding
* pros and cons of each
* Collaborative coding and it benefits(mention PBL)
* Types of collaborative coding pair/mob
* **Raise** the problem of not having a dedicated site for collaborative coding exercises in general and in **AAU** in particular.
* Elaborate ->Market research: while there exist some sites for competitive coding, there is not any for educational collaborative, group exercises/coding. 
* Make a questionary asking "coding" students how they do their group coding exercises, how they share, store and get feedback on them. + Other things if needed. (the purpose of the questionary is to emphasise the problem and make it significant)
* Analyse the questionary and "extract" the problems
* **Problems**: hard to get feedback on exercises, inconvenient methods of storing the solutions for the code(clutter: for example our p2 IWP channel), 

**Problem Statement:** How to improve the collaborative coding experience in group exercise in AAU through a website (that does something). 


**Solution Idea**(A wish list)
A website with the following features:
* One would have to login, with an(AAU)-email and a password
* One would be in the same group as in semester group.
* The front-end of the website will be like a server(similar to discord) where each group has their own semester server
* The server would have a "Channel/file" for the coding course(this could be extended to include other courses?)
* The exercises would be uploaded on the website(or all of the specific course channel/file could be premade by the teacher/professor)
* Each lecture would be a sub file in the course file.
* Each exercise would be a sub file of the lecture file.
* When a group start group coding section they could choose to either work in pairs or as a mob
* When working as pairs, they could choose to make the pairs them self or let the program do it
* When there are multiple pairs all solution would be saved
* When choosing to work as a mob program would pick a random person to be the one who code and in the following exercise another person would be picked.
* Instead of the trash can at the door, a group could ask for help in the program
* There also could be a chat where groups could ask the teacher assistant quick questions without having them to come over.
* + those features in Miro(maybe not the red ones as they conflict with other features or already solved)![[Pasted image 20240210000446.png]]

# P2 Organized Outline 

# Introduction
Some nonsense we write at the end

___
# Problem Analysis 

## 1. Types of Learning/Teaching
## 1. Traditional method 
* What is the traditional method of teaching (hint PBL book)

## 2. PBL

### 2.1 Different Approaches of PBL(Could be skipped)
* There exist different approaches to problem basset learning
* for example in UCN they group cycle is a week or two and end with a presentation, then new groups are formed. In AAU the group cycle is a whole semester. 
### 2.2 AAU's PBL Model 
* Introduce AAU's version of PBL
* The significance of Groups and groupwork in AAU

### 2.3 Collaborative Work 
* Introduce the different type of collaborate work. 
* How does collaborative work differ from individual work, pros and cons

#### 2.3.1 Collaborative Coding 
* What is collaborative coding 
* What is pair coding, pros and cons 
* What is mob coding, pros and cons

### 2.4 No Education Platform with PBL(change title)
* In general, There is no a dedicated website for education group work.
* In particular, despite AAU PBL model being heavily based on group work, there is not website for doing group work or group exercises.
#### 2.4.1 Market research
* Show different 

## 3. A Questionary For "coding student"
* General intro about this chapter: Making a Questionary for "cs/software/ any field that code" about their experience with doing group exercise.
*   Explain the purpose of the Questionary, that includes the different question we are asking.
* The Questionary as a starting point must revolve around three main points(asks invoking questions)
* 1. Doing the exercise as a group. How is it done? 
* 2. Storing the solutions for later review. (example: our IWP clutter channel) 
* 3. Getting feedback. 

## 3.1 Questionary Results 
* What are the result. (a nice graph/some statistics will do)
* if the results support our view. GOOD
* Extract the problems and magnify them 
* if the result does not support out bias delete this whole section.  
* The problems would probably be like the following **Problems**: hard to get feedback on exercises, inconvenient methods of storing the solutions for the code. Not always doing them in groups

____
# Problem Statement 

## Limitation & Scope
We could write the problem analysis in a way that it talks about group work/exercises in general, and in the limitation we could say that making a program that cover all types of exercise is too large of a scope. Therefore, we would limit ourself to making a educational platform/program that is dedicated for  group coding exercises. (I recomend doing the problem analysis on a broad scope then limiting the product to coding in this paragraph) 

## The Problem Statement
**Problem Statement:** How to improve the collaborative coding experience in group exercise in AAU through an educational website/program/platform... (that does something dedicated for group work). 
* that enable collaborative group working, better store solutions of exercises for later review,  and Improve the process of getting feedback (reformulate)

___
# Design
## Access 
* One must login with (AAU)-mail and a password.
* Groups are the same as semester group and are premade in the website by "the professor" (Another way of doing this could be...?)
* Each group when logging-in will get a "server" (like discord) with the course/s they have that semester. 
* The courses are organized in the following manner. A course will be a file, and each lecture will be a sub-file of the course, then each exercise would a sub-file of a lecture.

## Features(more like a wish list)
* When a group/member opens an exercise file they get the option to do the exercise individually, as pairs or mob.
* When choosing "mob" the program could chose a random person to be the one who code.  Then when moving to another exercise another person will be picked.
* When choosing pair the program could make them. 
* Direct chat with TA's for quick questions 
* A feature similar to Teams(the raise hand feature) where a group could request help in the group room
* And the other feature discussed in the group and mentioned in Miro![[Pasted image 20240210000446.png]]
* Maybe not the red ones, as they might conflict with other feature.
